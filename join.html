			<h2>Practices</h2>
			<p class="contenttext">Practices are held at 6 am M-F and 8 am on Saturday. We rotate through swims, bikes, weights, and runs. Here's the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RMLoPygZGN2sHE4kPSKjFH83uJ3ccjQQm8rwMpJKWpk/edit#gid=0">link to the schedule</a>, but if you lose it you can always find it again on the Facebook page (How nice!). Next day's practice will also be sent out via Twitter the night before. Meet at the pool deck for swims, at the indoor track next to the exercise science office for runs/weights, and at the bike racks outside the Fieldhouse for rides.</p>
			<h2>Equipment</h2>
			<p class="contenttext">Swims - you will need some sort of BYU-appropriate swimwear to swim. For guys, swim trunks work, but it adds a tremendous amount of drag. It's recommended to have a pair of Jammers or a speedo+dragsuit combo. A pair of goggles is HIGHLY recommended. Swim caps are optional. All of this can be found online, at most sports stores, or at Poco Loco, the local swim shop, located on University Avenue. </p>
			<p class="contenttext">Runs - get a pair of good running shoes. Runner's Corner, which is next to University Mall, can help you find a good pair that fits you. Also get comfortable running clothes including warm gear, gloves, and a hat for winter runs (We're in the Rockies!). </p>
			<p class="contenttext">Bikes - Any bike will work, but it's recommended that you have a road bike or TT/Triathlon Bike. These bikes can be very expensive, but there are a number of ways to keep the costs low. Amazon has a line of cheap road bikes, but you often get what you pay for. KSL and Craigslist have bikes going up for sale all the time and it is worth giving it a serious look. Outdoors Unlimited, BYU's outdoors store, also will help with a discount (around 20-25%) when you purchase a new bike from them and you get free maintenance for a YEAR! Outdoors Unlimited also rents out bikes for about $30 a day/weekend if you want to have one for a race. YOU MUST HAVE A HELMET TO RIDE WITH US (Period.)! Also it is highly recommended that you get clip-style pedals and shoes, as it makes the bike significantly easier and more efficient. We avoid riding in too cold of weather, but we live in Utah so same guidelines apply to winter gear for bikes as for runs. </p>
			<p class="contenttext">In addition to the essentials, you have the option to periodically purchase BYU Triathlon swag and gear. The most iconic is the BYU Triathlon jersey (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/120702384609802/photos/pb.120702384609802.-2207520000.1410546235./715483178465050/?type=3&theater">pictures!</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154255050870707&set=t.1148950193&type=3&theater">more pictures!</a>) which sells for just under $100. We are taking orders for these now. If you want one fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1blsYtkK0qrgP81DUE0jcDx-JHjeFRi43-6O6Q0JP4dk/edit">this order form</a> and we will be sure to get one for you!</p>
			<p class="contenttext">You will receive at least one T-shirt for being in the club in addition to some other gifts and goodies from time to time. </p>
			<p class="contenttext">When in doubt, ask a club member for help in picking the right gear.</p>
			<h2>Racing</h2>
			<p class="contenttext">We compete in a number of events throughout the year. Sometimes this list changes and people often go and do their own races, but as a team we compete in the following: </p>
			<p class="contenttext">Aqua Tri/ Camp Yuba - held at the beginning of the school year
			Pumpkinman - Late October, held in Las Vegas and compete against colleges
			<br>True Cougar Biathlon - A cheap, short biathlon the club holds for the student body
			<br>Turkey Tri - Early November, put on by Telos Triathlon in Orem
			<br>Kearns Indoor Tri Series - Indoor triathlon series held during the winter months
			<br>Havasu - March, Sectionals race against the other colleges, held in Lake Havasu City, AZ
			<br>Timp Tri - Same course as the Turkey Tri. April 18. Discount code: T3FRIEND. </p>
			<p class="contenttext">We try our best to get coupon codes for registration prices, but we ask that you pick up the registration cost yourself. We also are not allowed under the current policies to use club funds for travel so that expense will be divvied up among the participants as well. We try to find people to host us at the locations that we travel to so that we don't have to pay for hotel accommodations. </p>
			<p class="contenttext">If you don't want to/can't compete in a race but are still free to be there, we are always looking for volunteers for each of these events so mention that to the club officers. </p>
			<h2>Other</h2>
			<p class="contenttext">Utah has some of the best triathletes and endurance athletes in the world, and we sometimes are able to get them to come and speak or hold training clinics with us! Be on the lookout for those! </p>
			<p class="contenttext">If you have any further questions feel free to ask a club officer, send a Facebook message to the page, or send an email to byutriathlonclub@gmail.com and we will respond as soon as we can. Come on out to practice and feel free to try it out a couple of times before joining!</p>
